    "In our projectÂ to find the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh, we decided to focus on an essential factor that affects everyone's well-being: safety. Safety is a broad notion that considers a variety of elements such as crime rates, law enforcement efficacy, and community trust. By prioritizing safety as our primary metric, we aim to shed light on places where residents may feel comfortable.\n",
    "\n",
    "To quantify safety, we utilized two primary datasets: one focusing on arrests in Pittsburgh and the other on firearm seizures. Both datasets provide valuable insights into public safety by highlighting areas with higher incidents of law enforcement interventions and firearm-related incidents. By examining these datasets, we can gain a comprehensive understanding of the safety landscape across Pittsburgh neighborhoods.\n",
    "\n",
    "In measuring the safety of each neighborhood, we first filtered them for 2020 data in order to get a more pinpointed set of data, then we calculated separate ranks for each neighborhood based on the total number of arrests and seizures. Higher numbers of incidents corresponded to higher ranks, indicating areas with higher incident rates. For neighborhoods present in both datasets, we computed a combined rank by summing their individual ranks from both datasets. This approach provided a consolidated view of safety by considering both law enforcement interventions and firearm-related incidents. Finally, based on the combined ranks, we identified the top 3 \"safest\" neighborhoods with the lowest combined ranks, signifying lower incident rates and higher safety levels."
