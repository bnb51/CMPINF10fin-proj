    "In our project to find the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh, we decided to focus on an essential factor that affects everyone's well-being: safety. Safety is a broad notion that considers a variety of elements such as crime rates, law enforcement efficacy, community trust, and fire incident rates. By prioritizing safety as our primary metric, we aim to shed light on places where residents may feel comfortable and secure.\n",
    "\n",
    "To quantify safety, we utilized three primary datasets: one focusing on arrests in Pittsburgh, another on firearm seizures, and a third on fire incidents. Each dataset provides valuable insights into public safety by highlighting areas with higher incidents of law enforcement interventions, firearm-related incidents, and fire incidents. By examining these datasets, we can gain a comprehensive understanding of the safety landscape across Pittsburgh neighborhoods.\n",
    "\n",
    "In measuring the safety of each neighborhood, we first filtered them for 2020 data to obtain a more pinpointed set of data. Then, we calculated separate ranks for each neighborhood based on the total number of arrests, seizures, and fire incidents. Higher numbers of incidents corresponded to higher ranks, indicating areas with higher incident rates. For neighborhoods present in all three datasets, we computed a combined rank by summing their individual ranks from each dataset. This approach provided a consolidated view of safety by considering law enforcement interventions, firearm-related incidents, and fire incidents. Finally, based on the combined ranks, we identified the top 3 \"safest\" neighborhoods with the lowest combined ranks, signifying lower incident rates and higher safety levels across all three metrics."

    "After conducting a comprehensive analysis of safety across Pittsburgh neighborhoods using three key datasets—arrests, firearm seizures, and fire incidents—we have identified the top 3 \"safest\" neighborhoods for the year 2020. Our analysis considered multiple factors, including law enforcement interventions, firearm-related incidents, and fire incidents, to provide a holistic view of neighborhood safety.\n",

    "The top 3 \"safest\" neighborhoods in Pittsburgh for 2020, based on the lowest combined ranks across all three datasets, are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Chartiers City",
    "Swisshelm Park",
    "Esplen",
    "These neighborhoods demonstrated lower incident rates across all three metrics, indicating higher safety levels and providing residents with a sense of security and well-being. It is important to note that while these neighborhoods ranked the highest in terms of safety based on our analysis, safety is a complex and multifaceted concept that can be influenced by various factors beyond the scope of our datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our analysis highlights the importance of considering multiple factors, including law enforcement interventions, firearm-related incidents, and fire incidents, when evaluating neighborhood safety. By focusing on these key metrics and providing a consolidated view of safety across Pittsburgh neighborhoods, we aim to empower residents, policymakers, and community leaders to make informed decisions and take targeted actions to enhance public safety and well-being across the city."
